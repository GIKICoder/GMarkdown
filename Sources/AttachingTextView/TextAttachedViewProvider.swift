/**
 Describes a protocol that provides views inserted as subviews into text views that render a `SubviewTextAttachment`, and customizes their layout.
 - Note: Implementing this protocol is encouraged over providing a single view in a `SubviewTextAttachment`, because it allows attributed strings with subview attachments to be rendered in multiple text views at the same time: each text view would get its own subview that corresponds to the attachment.
